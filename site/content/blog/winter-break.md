So, my flight back to Singapore is exactly a week from now. Well, to be honest, this holiday has been extremely productive for me. In essence, the five weeks of my winter break is (was):

  - Week 1: Cyberia Camp
  - Week 2: Proyek Malin
  - Week 3: Road trip across Java
  - Week 4: Jogja!
  - Week 5: Rest back at home

All of these while developing [MyToDo](https://github.com/indocomsoft/cvwo-assignment-2017), a mobile-optimised To-Do list web application. I also made a (horrible) pun, cos I take trains a lot in Indonesia, so when I write stuffs in Rails when I am on the train, I develop Ruby on Rails... on Rails!!! (Okay, I'll see myself out.)
