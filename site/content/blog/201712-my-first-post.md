Heya readers,

So I decided to start blogging more seriously. This blog is most likely gonna be about my life and computing in general.

As for the title of the blog, it is actually from a song in Portuguese, *“Vamos todos / numa linda passarela / de uma aquarela / que um dia enfim / descolorirá”* which means "We are crossing / a beautiful footbridge / painted in watercolour / which will fade someday after all."

I’m not sure why I like all these poems about transitoriness. Like the poem by Sapardi Djoko Damono, *Yang Fana Adalah Waktu*:

~~~
Yang fana adalah waktu. Kita abadi:
memungut detik demi detik, merangkainya seperti bunga
sampai pada suatu hari
kita lupa untuk apa.
    "Tapi,
yang fana adalah waktu, bukan?"
tanyamu. Kita abadi.
~~~

Or in English

~~~
Time is transient. We are eternal:
plucking seconds, one by one, arranging them like flowers
until one day
we forget what for.
    "But,
time is transient, isn't it?"
you ask. We are eternal.
~~~

On another note, I am trying to write a musicalisation of that poem, but so far I’m stuck on the first line. No inspiration for the next lines. Here’s to hoping I’ll someday finish writing the song. Although it is painted in watercolour which will some day fade after all.
