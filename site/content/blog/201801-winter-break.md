So, my flight back to Singapore is exactly a week from now. Well, to be honest, this holiday has been extremely productive for me. In essence, the five weeks of my winter break is (was):

  - Week 1: Cyberia Camp
  - Week 2: Proyek Malin
  - Week 3: Road trip across Java
  - Week 4: Jogja!
  - Week 5: Rest back at home

All of these while developing [MyToDo](https://github.com/indocomsoft/cvwo-assignment-2017), a mobile-optimised To-Do list web application. I also made a (horrible) pun, cos I take trains a lot in Indonesia, so when I write stuffs in Rails when I am on the train, I develop Ruby on Rails... on Rails!!! (Okay, I'll see myself out.)

So anyway, here goes the details of my activities. This will be updated as I go along.

I learnt a great deal about Ruby on Rails! And especially achieving all what I had intended to learn during winter break. It was truly a great moment when I finally got my test coverage to be 100%.

Quoted from my final submission reflection:

> I was quite interested in doing TDD (Test-Driven Development) which implies achieving 100% code coverage, as well as integrating my project with various online tools such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Code Review tools. I was also interested in doing a many-to-many model relationship as the project I did before was only one-to-one or one-to-many.

It has Unicode support, is responsive (My X8 screen resolution is \\(480\times 320\\))
