- Using Wi-Fi routers connected via powerline adaptors to extend coverage from one point to the other, but one Wi-Fi router is used as a loadbalancer, utilising several other Wi-Fi routers in order to obtain higher speed on a Wi-Fi network with per-device speed limit.
- Wrote a shell script for monitoring and to generate traffic so as not to be logged out from the captive portal. Also wrote a script to parallelise rsync and downloads. More details available [here](https://github.com/indocomsoft/Maker-Portfolio).
